# Hskell: The hard part
This section contains what I personally experienced as being
the "hard part" of haskell. It took multiple attempts to get this
stuff right in my head.

This section contains more in depth comments on each topic.

It's mildly interesting to note that the alphabetical order of the directories
in this section happens to also comply with the degree of difficulty of the topic
they contain.

# The hard part
This place contains what I personally experienced as being
the "hard part" of Haskell. It took multiple attempts to get this
stuff right in my head.

This place contains more comments and examples on each topic.

Each section (folder) contains it's own readme, explaining the content and
an overview of what I think is the hard part.

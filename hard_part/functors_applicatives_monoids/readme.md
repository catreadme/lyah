# Functor, Applicative, Monoid
Those three typeclasses are essential for all further sections. The better
one understands those, even the rather trivial ones, the easier more advanced
topics will be.

Emphasis shall be put on the `Monoid` typeclass. Seeming so trivial I first
decided to more or less skip it. As it turned out in the end, that was a bad
idea.

The `newtype` wrapping of `tuples`, switching their type parameters, is also
something that was sort of hard to grasp.
